# Problem
Track tourists across city.

# Solution
## Multi-source tracking system
Many single-purpose services will seek and collect available information about people's locations from a specific source.

All data will be stored for the future analysis.
With collected data we can build heatmap of the city and mao it to the actual map.
! example map here !

### Examples of the tracking services
1. Scan social networks (like twitter, instagram) for a posts with related locations;
2. Place QR-codes at the points of interests to provide help and collect data
3. Place [iBeacons](https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/) at places of interest to provide help and collect data;
4. Place public WiFi hotspots to collect data;
5. Create a service to provide help with navigating through the city and collect data;
6. Place a surveillance cameras at the points of interest to analyze video-feed; 
7. Arrange a contract with mobile operators to receive a data about geo-position of the phones in the area;
8. Arrange a contract with hotels to collect information about number of guests;
9. Arrange a contract with taxi service to place geo-tracking devices into their's cars;
10. Arrange a contract with car rental service to place geo-tracking devices into their's cars;

With wide range of data-collector services we can build general heatmap of the city and find the "hot" spots where people are generally go.

Also, heatmap analytics crossed with general points of interests (like, shrines, museums, etc) can help find a "cold" places, which may be interesting for people, but for some reason they are not going (troubles with public transport, or navigation, or lack of marketing).

And, collected big data can be used in any other way.
